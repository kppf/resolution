Today is the day of Responsive design. So is your website responsive? How to know? Ya, you can check it by resizing your browser window, but what when you wish to check responsiveness of you website on the larger screen? On a better screen resolution? So here's the solution.

This is a web application based on javascript (jquery) and iframes which lets you check your websites/webapps against all different screen resolutions.

You can check websites running on your local server too!

[Help improving this 'Read Me'](mailto:kushagra.pandey@programofreaks.com)

TODO's
------

# Make the iframe size changable by the mouse pointer -- simlar to a textarea.
# Improve the Read ME.
# Make the app responsive itself.
# Add script to display a message when the url prevents itself from being displayed in iframes -- google, facebook etc.
# Add a dropdown to select from in the URL text field. This should be like the one in godaddy.com, but should show prefix instead of postfix.
# Add 'Fork On Github' ribbon.
# Add a div for advertisement.

ISSUES
------

# The web browser doesn't display full screen normally, so displaying the iframe at full resolution is wrong. Research and get the actual resolutions for all screen resolutions.
